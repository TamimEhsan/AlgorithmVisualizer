# Algorithm Visualizer

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. Limk to site: https://tamimehsan.github.io/AlgorithmVisualizer/
This is made to be the second version of my previous pathfinding project made with C++ igraphics. But then added some more visualizations too.  

So far there are 6 segemets  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game

I have implemented a total of 13 algorithms so far. And will try to add more later.  
ALgorithms implemented yet so far are
- DFS
- BFS
- Djsktra
- Recursive Maze Creation
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- N Queen Backtracking
- Graham Scan for Convex Hull
- Binary Search
I am not sure if anyone would like to contribute to this project or not. But any kind of contributions are welcomes. Also if you like this please star this repo. It keeps me motivated.
